# CS-300

In these projects I was analyzing the uses of different data structures and ways they could be used to solve the real world problem of importing course data from a csv file and performing functions such as printing the list of courses or sorting and searching the list.
I approached the problem with the knowledge that the primary function of the program was to sort and print the course data, as well as searching the data for a specific course. In project one, I decided that the hash table would be appropriate, but I later changed that to the vector data structure in project two becuase the alphanumeric codes for the classes (MATH310) were difficult to hash properly and would not sort easily.
I came to realize the likelyhood that there wouldn't be an excessive amount of data in the file and data structure since there can only be so many different classes and there wouldn't be any duplicate data; this is why I later decided that the vector would be the best structure.
These projects made me realize that there is always a different way to solve a problem; I ran into great difficulty trying to write the program with a hash table data structure, and decided reluctantly to restrart using the vector instead. This proved to be a good decision and I was able to finish the project without any roadblocks.
I was also able to reuse a lot of code from the previous assignments in this class, which taught me the importance of writing adaptable code that can be applied in other projects, since it definitely saved me time when I switched data structures in project two.
